# List of Inventions
A collection of essential resources related to cyber threat intelligence theory.

### `Scientific Publications`
I include these publications to demonstrate that I am familiar with the process of writing and publishing academic research. Both papers are collaborative pieces, which further reflect common academic practice of teamwork and collaborative creative processes.

| Frida von Zahn, Lawrence Schätzle  | I include this publication because it is the first paper that I presented at an acamdeic conference and that I have now submitted for an academic journal. I wrote it together with a colleague, who did conducted the interviews and focus group sessions together with me. |https://irspm2024.exordo.com/files/papers/814/final_draft/Sharing_is_Caring_Paper_vonZahn_Schaetzle_IRSPM_2024.pdf|
