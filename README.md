# List of Inventions


### `Scientific Publications`
I include these publications to demonstrate that I am familiar with the process of writing and publishing academic research. Both papers are collaborative pieces, which further reflect common academic practice of teamwork and collaborative creative processes.

| Author | Description | Resource URL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frida von Zahn, Lawrence Schätzle  | This is the first paper that I presented at an acamdeic conference and that I have now submitted for an academic journal. I wrote it together with a colleague, who conducted the interviews and focus group sessions together with me. This made the writing process really fruitful as we had a shared understanding of our empirical material. |https://irspm2024.exordo.com/files/papers/814/final_draft/Sharing_is_Caring_Paper_vonZahn_Schaetzle_IRSPM_2024.pdf|
| Henrik Scheller, Christian Raffer, Frida von Zahn, Oliver Peters | This paper is written in German, but it was the first paper I ever wrote at my current job. I was responsible for the section challenges on conflicts, which was a considerable challenge for me since the co-authors are all experts in municipal finance, and I am glad to have learned much about the field in the writing process. | https://difu.de/publikationen/2023/sustainable-finance-fuer-kommunen |
| Nils May, Heiner von Lüpke, Camila Yamahaki, Gustavo Velloso Breviglieri, Annelise Vendramini, Samantha Keen, Harald Winkler, Tamiksha Singh, Saumya Malhotra, Jalpa Mishra, Julie Emmrich, Lukas Kahlen, Katharina Lütkehermöller, Cor Marijs, Alessa Widmaier, Imad Ahmed, Djoko Suroso, Budhi Setiawan, Sita Primadevi, Karsten Neuhoff, David Rusnok, Lucie Bioret, Frida von Zahn | I co-authored this paper as a student assistant at the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW). I include it because of the many authors involved and the challenging writing and editing process of this synthesis report, which was a great learning experience. I was mainly invovled in doing and writing the literature review, and the editing of the entire report. |(https://www.diw.de/de/diw_01.c.857288.de/publikationen/sonstige_diw_publikationen/2020_0000/transformational_change_towards_low-carbon_development_in_em___economies__insights_from_international_climate_finance_cases.html) |
