# List of Inventions


### `Scientific Publications`
I include these publications to demonstrate that I am familiar with the process of writing and publishing academic research. Both papers are collaborative pieces, which further reflect common academic practice of teamwork and collaborative creative processes.

| Frida von Zahn, Lawrence Schätzle  | This is the first paper that I presented at an acamdeic conference and that I have now submitted for an academic journal. I wrote it together with a colleague, who conducted the interviews and focus group sessions together with me. This made the writing process really fruitful as we had a shared understanding of our empirical material. | [Sharing is Caring](https://irspm2024.exordo.com/files/papers/814/final_draft/Sharing_is_Caring_Paper_vonZahn_Schaetzle_IRSPM_2024.pdf)|
| Henrik Scheller, Christian Raffer, Frida von Zahn, Oliver Peters | This paper is written in German, but it was the first paper I ever wrote at my current job. I was responsible for the section challenges on conflicts, which was a considerable challenge for me since the co-authors are all experts in municipal finance, and I am glad to have learned much about the field in the writing process. | [Sustainable Finance für Kommunen](https://difu.de/publikationen/2023/sustainable-finance-fuer-kommunen)|
| Nils May, Heiner von Lüpke, Camila Yamahaki, Gustavo Velloso Breviglieri, Annelise Vendramini, Samantha Keen, Harald Winkler, Tamiksha Singh, Saumya Malhotra, Jalpa Mishra, Julie Emmrich, Lukas Kahlen, Katharina Lütkehermöller, Cor Marijs, Alessa Widmaier, Imad Ahmed, Djoko Suroso, Budhi Setiawan, Sita Primadevi, Karsten Neuhoff, David Rusnok, Lucie Bioret, Frida von Zahn | I co-authored this paper as a student assistant at the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW). I include it because of the many authors involved and the challenging writing and editing process of this synthesis report, which was a great learning experience. I was mainly invovled in doing and writing the literature review, and the editing of the entire report. |[SNAPFI Synthesis Report](https://www.diw.de/de/diw_01.c.857288.de/publikationen/sonstige_diw_publikationen/2020_0000/transformational_change_towards_low-carbon_development_in_em___economies__insights_from_international_climate_finance_cases.html) |

### `University Papers`
I inlcude these papers for several reasons. Some, such as my master thesis, do not have a quantiative methodology, but I very much enjoyed the writing and researching process. I include these to show that I can easily be interested in a variety of phenomena and methods, and that I dedicate time and effort to questions in different disciplines. Other projects demonstrate that I am familiar with quantitative methods in the social sciences and include coding and data visualization excercises.

| Frida von Zahn | For my master thesis I analysed whether and how popcultural phenomena such as superheroes influence political rhetoric through qualitative content analysis. I thoroughly enjoyed this research project, and could have spent many more months researching this phenomenon.  | [OODA_Loop.html](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop) |
| Frida von Zahn | This paper on standing ovations is the first paper I ever wrote at university. I refer to it in my vision letter, because it reminds me of the process of finding and formalizing a PhD research project. It the first time I was deeply fascinated by a research process, and I am still grateful for this course to be the introduction to my university education. I could not have wished for a better start. | [the-pyramid-of-pain.html](https://detect-respond.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-pyramid-of-pain.html) |
| Frida von Zahn | For this replication project in my class on causal inference, we had the task to replicate and expand on the research of a published paper deploying instrumental variable design. It was the first time I had to test my newly learned knowledge in statistics and R, which was overwhelming at first, but immensly rewarding when accomplished. It gave me the confidence to pursue more courses on quantitative methods, and sparked my motivation for a research career. | [diamond.pdf](https://www.activeresponse.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/diamond.pdf?adlt=strict) |
| [Lockheed Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin) | `The Cyber Kill Chain® framework` - is part of the Intelligence Driven Defense® model for the identification and prevention of cyber intrusions activity. The model identifies what the adversaries must complete in order to achieve their objective | [Cyber_Kill_Chain.pdf](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/rms/documents/cyber/Gaining_the_Advantage_Cyber_Kill_Chain.pdf) |
| [Lockheed Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin) | `The Courses of Action matrix` -  using the 7 Action Ds of detect, deny, disrupt, degrade, deceive, and destroy to counter cyber intrusions | [LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/rms/documents/cyber/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf) |
| MITRE | `The MITRE ATT&CK® framework` - is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. | [attack.mitre.org](https://attack.mitre.org/) |
| Mandiant | `The Targeted Attack Lifecycle` - Mandiant’s depiction of the targeted attack lifecycle illustrates the major phases of a typical intrusion. | [mandiant.com](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/targeted-attack-lifecycle) |
| [Paul Pols](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulpols) | `The Unified Kill Chain` - was developed through a hybrid research approach, combining design science with qualitative research methods. The Unified Kill Chain extends and combines existing models, such as Lockheed Martin's Cyber Kill Chain® and MITRE's ATT&CK® | [unifiedkillchain.com](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/) |
| Verizon | `The VERIS framework` - uses a common language and a structured, repeatable process, both of which allow organizations to objectively classify security incidents. Used for Verizon's DBIR. | [verizon.com](https://www.verizon.com/about/news/veris-framework-enables-sharing-security-incident-data-across-globe) |
| IBM X-Force | `The Cyberattack Preparation Framework` and `The Cyberattack Execution Framework` - provide a logical flow representative of attacks today and they also incorporate phases not typically included in other frameworks | [ibm.com](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/A27KQP8R) |
