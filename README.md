# List of Inventions


### `Scientific Publications`
I include these publications to demonstrate that I am familiar with the process of writing and publishing academic research. Both papers are collaborative pieces, which further reflect common academic practice of teamwork and collaborative creative processes.

| Title | Author(s), Year | Project Context | Description | Resource URL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Sharing is Caring - Effective local crisis management through practice sharing| Frida von Zahn, Lawrence Schätzle (2024)  | Research Project [PanReflex](https://www.panreflex.de) | This is the first paper that I presented at an acamdeic conference and that I have now submitted for an academic journal. I wrote it together with a colleague, who conducted the interviews and focus group sessions together with me. This made the writing process really fruitful as we had a shared understanding of our empirical material. | [Sharing is Caring](https://irspm2024.exordo.com/files/papers/814/final_draft/Sharing_is_Caring_Paper_vonZahn_Schaetzle_IRSPM_2024.pdf)|
| Sustainable Finance für Kommunen |Henrik Scheller, Christian Raffer, Frida von Zahn, Oliver Peters (2023) | Research Project [KlimKomInvest](https://difu.de/projekte/nachhaltige-finanzierung-kommunaler-investitionen) |This paper is written in German, but it was the first paper I ever wrote at my current job. I was responsible for the section challenges on conflicts, which was a considerable challenge for me since the co-authors are all experts in municipal finance, and I am glad to have learned much about the field in the writing process. | [Sustainable Finance für Kommunen](https://difu.de/publikationen/2023/sustainable-finance-fuer-kommunen)|
|Transformational change towards low-carbon development in emerging economies: insights from international climate finance cases| Nils May, Heiner von Lüpke, Camila Yamahaki, Gustavo Velloso Breviglieri, Annelise Vendramini, Samantha Keen, Harald Winkler, Tamiksha Singh, Saumya Malhotra, Jalpa Mishra, Julie Emmrich, Lukas Kahlen, Katharina Lütkehermöller, Cor Marijs, Alessa Widmaier, Imad Ahmed, Djoko Suroso, Budhi Setiawan, Sita Primadevi, Karsten Neuhoff, David Rusnok, Lucie Bioret, Frida von Zahn (2020) | Research Project [SNAPFI](https://www.diw.de/de/diw_01.c.857288.de/publikationen/sonstige_diw_publikationen/2020_0000/transformational_change_towards_low-carbon_development_in_em___economies__insights_from_international_climate_finance_cases.html)|I co-authored this paper as a student assistant at the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW). I include it because of the many authors involved and the challenging writing and editing process of this synthesis report, which was a great learning experience. I was mainly invovled in doing and writing the literature review, and the editing of the entire report. |[SNAPFI Synthesis Report](https://www.diw.de/de/diw_01.c.857288.de/publikationen/sonstige_diw_publikationen/2020_0000/transformational_change_towards_low-carbon_development_in_em___economies__insights_from_international_climate_finance_cases.html) |

### `University Papers`
I inlcude these papers for several reasons. Some, such as my master thesis, do not have a quantiative methodology, but I very much enjoyed the writing and researching process. I include these to show that I can easily be interested in a variety of phenomena and methods, and that I dedicate time and effort to questions in different disciplines. Other projects demonstrate that I am familiar with quantitative methods in the social sciences and include coding and data visualization excercises.  

| Title | Author(s), Year | Course | Description | Resource URL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|I wish we could send in Iron Man | Frida von Zahn (2022) |Master thesis| For my master thesis I analysed whether and how popcultural phenomena such as superheroes influence political rhetoric through qualitative content analysis. I thoroughly enjoyed this research project, and could have spent many more months researching this phenomenon.  | [Thesis](https://github.com/FridaNordland/List-of-Inventions/blob/830c322770545460403da3040f0318ac8e19a86b/Inventions/vonzahn_frida_master_thesis.pdf) |
| The Phenomenon of Standing Ovations |Frida von Zahn (2016) | Modelling Nature - Theory Construction and Modelling Techniques| This paper on standing ovations is the first paper I ever wrote at university. I refer to it in my vision letter, because it reminds me of the process of finding and formalizing a PhD research project. It the first time I was deeply fascinated by a research process, and I am still grateful for this course to be the introduction to my university education. I could not have wished for a better start. | [the-pyramid-of-pain.html](https://detect-respond.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-pyramid-of-pain.html) |
|Replication of Paper 3: Dissent and Mobilization| Frida von Zahn (2020) |Statistics II - Causal Inference | For this replication project in my class on causal inference, we had the task to replicate and expand on the research of a published paper deploying instrumental variable analysis. It was the first time I had to test my newly learned knowledge in statistics and R, which was overwhelming at first, but immensly rewarding when accomplished. It gave me the confidence to pursue more courses on quantitative methods, and sparked my motivation for a research career. | [Replication Project](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/FridaNordland/List-of-Inventions/blob/main/Inventions/198421_FridavonZahn_FinalResearchProject_MakingSenseofMessyData.html) |
|Do Countries Bounce Back?| Frida von Zahn (2022) | Making Sense of Messy Data| This is another statistics exercise for the course "Making sense of messy data", which deploys a difference in difference design. This project had a smaller scope, but taught me to wrangle and clean 'messy' real world data. Whilst my hypothesis did not show any results, I learned a lot in terms of data cleaning and preparation for my current research work, where I often work with 'messy' survey data. | [Cyber_Kill_Chain.pdf](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/rms/documents/cyber/Gaining_the_Advantage_Cyber_Kill_Chain.pdf) |
|Can Red-Tailed Hawks become Rats with Wings?| Frida von Zahn (2021) |Birds of Conflict| This is a paper that I wrote for a course in my semester abroad for a course on the intersection of birds and politics. I include it not because of a certain mothodology or theory, but because it was a fun writing project, and I am grateful for having had the chance to engage with such a diverse range of topics in my university education. | [LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/rms/documents/cyber/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf) |

### `Other Projects`
I liked the breadth of allowed topics for the list of inventions, which is why I would like to inlcude a couple of projects that are not as tangible as academic papers. Some of these do not have any physical output, which is why I only included a description.

| Project | Description | Resource URL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dance and Theatre Projects | Throughout my entire life, I took part in the design and staging of several operas, plays, dance competitions and performances. Always a hobby of mine, I wanted to include them here because these types of projects are often just as creative, collaborative and challenging as academic writing projects. | [OODA_Loop.html](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop) |
| Course on gender- and climate politics in Switzerland, final 'show' at Summer School 2022| Through the initiative of a friend, I got the chance to design and teach a course on gender- and climate politics in Switzerland, where I lived and worked for eigth months. Each day included five hours of teaching, which meant a lot of preparation, but it was a very rewarding experience, which also reaffirmed my motivation for teaching in the future. Due to my affinity for performances, I was also in charge to write and stage the 'teachers' performance' on the last evening of the summer school, which was equally entertaining and rewarding. | [LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/rms/documents/cyber/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf) |
|Blog on European Voluntary Service in Norway, 2015-2016| During my European Voluntary Service, I wrote a blog on my experiences for family and friends. Though written in German and as a 17-/ 18-year old teenager, I included this blog nonetheless because it was the first time I committed to a writing project for an entire year, and some writing shows critical engagement with my education and upbringing, which influenced my following university education significatnly. | [LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/rms/documents/cyber/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf) |
